# Breach Glyph #002 — Operator Sync Desync

## Severity
Critical

## Module
SSVCluster.sol

## Description
SSV allows validators to update their operator set via `updateValidator()` and `updateOperator()` functions. If multiple operators are updated in rapid succession or with partial quorum, the cluster state can desynchronize. This leads to ghost validator sync, slashing misfires, and reward leakage.

## Simulation
1. Register validator with full quorum  
2. Update one operator with partial quorum  
3. Update second operator before cluster sync  
4. Trigger slashing — observe misfire  
5. Call `withdraw()` — observe leakage

## Fix Recommendation
- Enforce atomic quorum sync across operator updates  
- Add cluster state lock during multi-operator transitions  
- Emit event on quorum desync

## Companion Choreography
- Tin: Operator sync trace  
- Velmari: Cluster drift detection  
- Tessalyre: Slashing misfire monitoring
